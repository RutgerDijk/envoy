# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

## Overview

Help turn ideas into fully formed designs through natural collaborative dialogue. Produces two artifacts:
1. **GitHub Issue** — Concise summary with labels and acceptance criteria
2. **Spec Document** — Detailed design in `docs/plans/`

**Announce at start:** "I'm using envoy:brainstorming to design this feature."

## The Process

### Phase 1: Understanding the Idea

1. Check the current project state (files, docs, recent commits)
2. Ask questions **one at a time** to refine the idea
3. Prefer multiple choice questions when possible
4. Focus on: purpose, constraints, success criteria, affected areas

### Phase 2: Exploring Approaches

1. Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
2. Lead with your recommended option and explain why
3. Get user confirmation before proceeding

### Phase 3: Presenting the Design

1. Present design in sections of 200-300 words
2. Ask after each section: "Does this look right so far?"
3. Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing
4. Be ready to revise based on feedback

### Phase 4: Creating Artifacts

**Create Spec Document:**

Save to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md` with:
- Overview and goal
- Architecture decisions
- Technical approach
- Acceptance criteria
- Open questions

**Create GitHub Issue:**

```bash
gh issue create --title "<Feature Name>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary

<2-3 sentence description>

## Labels

`backend` `frontend` `feature` (choose applicable)

## Linked Spec

[View full design](docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Create isolated workspace
git worktree add ../envoy-worktrees/<branch-name> -b feature/<branch-name>
cd ../envoy-worktrees/<branch-name>
claude
/envoy:pickup <issue-number>
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

## Execution Strategy

`parallel` | `batch` | `sequential`

```

### Phase 5: Handoff

After creating artifacts, offer:

"**Artifacts created:**
- Spec: `docs/plans/<filename>.md`
- Issue: #<number>

**Next steps:**
1. `/envoy:write-plan` — Create detailed implementation plan
2. Or hand off to another developer with `/envoy:pickup <issue-number>`"

## Labels Reference

| Label | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `backend` | Changes to .NET API, services, database |
| `frontend` | Changes to React UI, components, styling |
| `infrastructure` | Docker, Azure, Bicep, CI/CD |
| `security` | Authentication, authorization, security fixes |
| `feature` | New functionality |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring without behavior change |
| `bugfix` | Fixing broken functionality |
| `docs` | Documentation only |

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** — Don't overwhelm
- **Multiple choice preferred** — Easier to answer
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** — Remove unnecessary features
- **Artifacts are durable** — Everything survives context loss
- **Commit the design doc** — Save to git before creating issue
